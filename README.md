# Javascript Training Tasks

Training setup for programming tasks by Boris Cherny found [here](https://performancejs.com/post/hde6d32/The-Best-Frontend-JavaScript-Interview-Questions-(Written-by-a-Frontend-Engineer)).
Tests and function bodies are provided, so you can start the testrunner and try to fix the functions.
My own solutions are stored in [solutions](https://github.com/anszu/javascript-training/tree/master/src/solutions) but the most elegant communizy-driven solutions can
be found [here](https://github.com/bcherny/frontend-interview-questions).

## Getting Started

1. Clone Repo with ```git clone git@github.com:anszu/javascript-training.git```
2. Install packages with ```npm install```
3. Run ```npm run test```
4. Fix tests by fixing the functions

## Environment

Testing is done with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and via [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), so feel free to use the latest JS functionalities. There is also [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) in place using [airbnb's linting scheme](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb).
